# 🌐 End-to-End Data Engineering Project on Azure

Welcome to this comprehensive End-to-End Data Engineering project, where we walk through building a modern data pipeline leveraging Microsoft's Azure ecosystem along with open-source tools like Apache Spark. This project is ideal for those aspiring to become Data Engineers and want real-world exposure to data integration, transformation, and analytics.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-time, scalable data engineering solution using the medication dataset from Kaggle. We demonstrate how to process raw data into insights using a multi-layer architecture involving Bronze (Raw), Silver (Cleansed), and Gold (Analytics) zones.
